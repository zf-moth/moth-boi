# Hello there and welcome to my GitHub page 👋

So i'm just guy from Czech Republic who happens to be 18 years old. I live in small village and i really like coding and game dev. There isn't really much interesting about me other then i also do Rock Climbing. I have created my first game when i was around 9 or 10, and since then i just fell in love with coding and video games. So yea. I just wanna make my portofilo here.
